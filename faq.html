                <h2>What to expect in a day with easyfishnco</h2>
                <p>On the day of your trip, you are responsible for meeting at a predetermined landing area at a certain time where your adventure begins. Once you arrive, you will board on one of our snowmobiles to be shuttled to the fishing location. From there, the fishing begins inside the hut and you will be taught to catch the specific target fish of the day. As part of our service, we will cook the fish that you catch. Photos and videos are recommended! At the end of your 5 hours, we will shuttle you back to the landing.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>What do I need to know about fishing?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely nothing. You show up in your warmest clothes that you don’t mind getting a little dirty, and learn how to enjoy an activity that thrills our team everyday we go fish. Although we do say that, <span class="bold">this is an activity where you get a return for the effort you put in</span>. It’s always helpful to Youtube and watch a couple of instructional videos fishing for a specific species that we intend to catch. Don’t worry, we’ll give you more info once we confirm our fishing location.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Do I need a fishing license?</h2>
                <p>If you are older than 18, you will require a fishing license. You can purchase a fishing license yourself at <a href="https://huntandfishontario.com">https://huntandfishontario.com</a> or we can help you with purchasing a single day fishing license. <span class="bold">Please note that this licensing fee is not included in the cost of the trip with Easyfishnco.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>Since you are going to be travelling on a snowmobile, the government recommends a minimum of 6” of ice. We will ensure that we have checked the ice on the exact route we will take prior to taking anyone out. We will not take risks and call off a fishing trip if the weather is not favourable to the ice conditions. Although no ice is guaranteed to be safe, we will take every precaution to make a safe and comfortable trip for you and your group.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Am I allowed to keep more fish to bring home?</h2>
                <p>Yes, you are legally allowed to keep more fish as long as it is within your legal limit. We will inform you of the limit as we are catching the fish. Although it is within your legal right, we do suggest responsibly keeping fish instead of keeping everything you catch. We do suggest releasing the bigger fish of each species as they are really old and also higher in toxins. You will also be responsible for having a container to bring the fish home.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Age Groups</h2>
                <p>Our adventure is offered to both children and adults. Keep in mind that there will be some minor physical activity of catching a fish so be capable and prepared for it. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Time of Day</h2>
                <p>Remember that fishing is a sport. Don’t come hungry. You will be exerting, even if just a little. When going on a trip with us, we are including a meal during your adventure. We will be offering two time windows - one morning and one afternoon session. <span class="bold">The morning starts at 7:00AM and the afternoon session starts at 12:00PM. Each adventure is a minimum of 4 hours.</span></p>

                <h2>Prices</h2>
                <p>Prices are variable, depending on the size of the group. The minimum pricing regardless of the number of people would be $350 per trip. We are able to accomodate groups of as many as 10 people. (Group size limits may change according to Ontario COVID protocol at the current time)</p>
