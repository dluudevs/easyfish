                <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
                <p>Fishing and boating are potentially dangerous activities. Easyfishnco adheres to the highest safety and training standards but there are inherent risks which we can not control and can not be eliminated. You must be aware of these risks before you take a trip with us. </p><BR>

                <p>The following describes some, but not all of those risks. Risks include, but are not limited to: death, drowning, bodily injury, sunburn, dehydration, insect or animal bites, encounters with wildlife, and other harm which may be encountered in participating in ice fishing, boating, guided and unguided fishing, and those activities associated therewith. I expressly agree, and promise to accept and assume all responsibilities and risk of injury, death, illness or disease, or damage to myself, to others, or to my property, arising from my participation in this activity. In signing this document I fully recognize that if anyone is hurt or property is damaged while I engage in this event, I will have no right to make claim or file a lawsuit against Easyfishnco or its officers, agents, contractors, or employees.</p><BR>

                <p>PHYSICAL HEALTH: To the best of my knowledge I, the client, have no physical restrictions which would prohibit my participation in any-and-all activities offered by Easyfishnco, including fishing, boating, boarding or disembarking the vessel, or consuming food or beverage prepared by the outfitter or their representatives. I certify that I have sufficient health, accident, and liability insurance to cover any bodily injury or property damage I may incur while participating in this event and to cover bodily injury or property damage caused to a third party as a result of my participation in this event. If I have no insurance, I certify that I am capable of personally paying for any and all such expenses or liabilities. Should emergency medical services become necessary to me or any minor I have authorized to participate, I agree that I will not hold Easyfishnco liable regarding the provision of medical and/or emergency care or the adequacy of any such care. Easyfishnco reserves the right to decline service to any person it judges incapable of meeting the requirements of participating in fishing related activities.</p><BR>

                <p>I acknowledge that Easyfishnco will provide life jackets, or helmets for me and any minor accompanying me and I/we are advised to wear it at all times while on the vessel, at the marina or launch area, or when otherwise instructed to do so. Failure to do so is at my/our own risk. In a motor boat under power, appropriate PFD must be worn at all times without exception.</p><BR>

                <p>I understand and acknowledge that the activity I am about to voluntarily engage in as a participant bears certain known and unanticipated risks as described in this document. I expressly agree, and promise to accept and assume all responsibilities of all risks while I engage in this event, and agree that I will have no right to make claim or file a lawsuit against Easyfishnco, or its officers, contractors, agents, or employees. By signing this Agreement I, myself, or as parent or guardian of any accompanying minor, unconditionally release and hold harmless Easyfishnco and/or their representatives against and for all liability, cost, expenses, claims and damages for which the guide might otherwise become liable by reason of any accident, illness or injuries to, or death of, any persons, or damage to property or both, in any manner arising or resulting from, caused by, connected with or related to the participation in any activity or service offered by Easyfishnco, regardless of how, where, or when such injury, illness, death or damage occurs even if caused by the negligence of the guide, its agent, contractor, or employees, or due to conditions, defects in the vessel, equipment or activities.</p><BR>

                <p>COVID-19 STATEMENT: In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Easyfishnco is taking all possible precautions and will continue to follow local and state regulations. You understand and acknowledge that there may be a risk of exposure while participating in this voluntary activity and unconditionally release and hold harmless Easyfishnco for any matters related to COVID-19.</p>
