                <h2>What to expect in a day with easyfishnco</h2>
                <p>On the day of your trip, you are responsible for meeting at a predetermined landing area at a certain time where your adventure begins. Once you arrive, you will board on one of our brand new pontoon, and let the fun begin. From there, the fishing begins and you will be taught to catch the specific target fish of the day. As part of our service, we will cook the fish that you catch. Photos and videos are recommended! At the end of your 5 hours, we will shuttle you back to the landing.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>What do I need to know about fishing?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely nothing. You show up the appropriate clothing for the day that you don’t mind getting a little dirty, and learn how to enjoy an activity that thrills our team everyday we go fish. Although we do say that, <span class="bold">this is an activity where you get a return for the effort you put in</span>. It’s always helpful to Youtube and watch a couple of instructional videos fishing for a specific species that we intend to catch. Don’t worry, we’ll give you more info once we confirm our fishing location.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Do I need a fishing license?</h2>
                <p>If you are older than 18, you will require a fishing license. You can purchase a fishing license yourself at <a href="https://huntandfishontario.com">https://huntandfishontario.com</a> or we can help you with purchasing a single day fishing license. <span class="bold">Please note that this licensing fee is not included in the cost of the trip with Easyfish & co.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>From the moment you board the boat, you will have access to a life jacket. When the motor is running, we will require you to wear the life jacket until the motor stops. No risks are going to be taken when aboard one of our adventures.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Am I allowed to keep fish to bring home?</h2>
                <p>Yes, you are legally allowed to keep more fish as long as it is within your legal limit. Although it is within your legal right, we suggest you to keep fish responsibly. We advise releasing the bigger fish as they are old and also higher in toxins. You will be responsible for having a container to bring the fish home.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Age Groups</h2>
                <p>Our adventure is offered to both children and adults. Keep in mind that there will be some minor physical activity of catching a fish so be capable and prepared for it. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Time of Day</h2>
                <p>Remember that fishing is a sport. Don’t come hungry. You will be exerting, even if just a little. When going on a trip with us, we are including a meal during your adventure. We will be offering two time windows - one morning and one afternoon session. <span class="bold">The morning starts at 7:00AM and the afternoon session starts at 12:00PM. Each adventure is a minimum of 4 hours.</span></p>

                <h2>Prices</h2>
                <p>Prices are variable, depending on the size of the group and the package you are joining. We are able to accomodate groups of as many as 6 people. (Group size limits may change according to Ontario COVID protocol at the current time)</p>
